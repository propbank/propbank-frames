<!--
                    dtd for predicate argument lexicon files

 Each file will contain a set of predicates associated with a particular
 lemma (including phrasal variants,  like 'keep_from', etc)

 Each predicate will contain a set of roles in an entity called a roleset.  The
 rolesets give mneumonics of the argument labels for each different set of
 arguments.  Multiple rolesets per predicate are necessary for the accomodation
 of different senses of the predicate.

 Each roleset associates the argument labels with a set of examples
 demonstrating some of the primary considerations in predicate argument
 annotation for the predicate+roleset in consideration.  The examples contain
 plain text sentences and then assign arguments to segments of the sentence.
 The examples usually have names which are often space delimited descriptions
 of the annotation.  The examples often have types which describe, in a
 nutshell, some primary linguistic properties such as "benefactive" or
 "agentive".  The type attribute may also include a phrasal particle variant
 (eg type="keep pace") so as to indicate the guidelines for annotation of these
 cases.

 The entire document can be decorated with notes for unstructured description of
 the information presented.

  The roleset's levine class attribute takes the following form:

  -|\d+(\.\d+)*( \d+(\.\d+)*)*

  where '-' means there is no levine class
  and something like 47.2 means 47.2 is a levine class of this
  roleset.  The list of levine classes is space delimited

  roles have a number (or actually a number or an "M" or an "A" associated
  with them.  The "M" stands for modifier and the "A" stands for agent.
  The "A" is the agent only in the case where arg 0 is not agentive
  (eg verbs that can take causative constructions). This number is encoded in
  the attribute 'n'

  'f' is an attribute which may contain function tags.  The current list of
  available function tags are

    EXT  extent
    LOC  location
    DIR  direction
    NEG  negation  (not in PREDITOR)
    MOD  general modification
    ADV  adverbial modification
    MNR  manner
    PRD  secondary predication
    REC  recipricol (eg herself, etc)
    TMP  temporal
    PRP  purpose
    PNC  purpose no cause (no longer used)
    CAU  cause
    ADJ  adjectival (nouns only)
    COM  comitative
    DIS  discourse
    DSP  direct speech
    GOL  goal
    PAG  prototypical agent (function tag for arg1)
    PPT  prototypical patient (function tag for arg1)
    RCL  relative clause (no longer used)
    SLC  selectional constraint link
    VSP  verb specific (function tag for numbered arguments)
    LVB  light verb (for nouns only)


  additionally, function tags may be prepositions, indicating that the
  preposition in question can be associated with the argument/role
  presented.  For this reason, we can't restrict the values to an
  enumeration :(.

  The roles also have a 'vnr' attribute, which refers
  to verbnet v0.2 thematic roles.  Verbnet thematic roles are
