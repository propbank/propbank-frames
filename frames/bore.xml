      <note>BORE-V NOTES: Frames file for 'bore' based on sentences in wsj. Verbnet entry 21.2-2, Framenet entry Experiencer obj. Note that those refer to different rolesets. (from bore.01-v predicate notes)</note>
      <note>BORED-J NOTES: Roleset based on instances in BOLT P01, parts 2,3. Verbnet entry 21.2-2. Framed by Claire. I'm not actually certain that this can come up as an adj, but given the difficulty in distinguishing verbs, adjectives in English... Differs from verb frame in that instrument and cause don't seem grammatically separable for adjective. (from bored.01-j)</note>
