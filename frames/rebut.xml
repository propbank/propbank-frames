      <note>REBUT-V NOTES: Frames file for 'rebut' based on sentences in financial subcorpus. No Verbnet entry, no Framenet entry, which isn't surprising because this is a made-up verb, backformed from"rebuttal". No comparison. (from rebut.01-v predicate notes)</note>
      <note>REBUTTAL-N NOTES: Added by Julia based on BOLT, Wordnet, rebut.01. No VNcls. (from rebuttal.01-n)</note>
