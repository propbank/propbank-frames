      <note>STAB-V NOTES: Note that the result and the location cannot cooccur: "John wasstabbed to death in the back". This is clearly not a syntacticvalency problem, since this has no more phrases than the lastexample. (from stab.01-v)</note>
      <note>STAB-N NOTES: Based on verb entry stab.01. Verbnet entries 42.2 and 18.2 (from stab.01-n)</note>
      <note>STABBING-N NOTES: Added by Julia based on BOLT, stab-v.01. Corresponds to VNcls Poison-42.2, Poke-19, Swat-18.2. (from stabbing.01-n)</note>
      <note>STABB-V NOTES: hand-checked by Kevin (from stabb.01-v)</note>

        <note>Arg3 from verb frame separated into two separate args. Even though co-occuring LOC and resultative args are awkward, there are some examples out there, and regardless, it seemed more useful to be able to differentiate them. (from stabbing.01-n)</note>
