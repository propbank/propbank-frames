        <text>This relentless obsession with white privelege and equal opportunities is absurd in the Britain of 2011 ; most of the richest men in the country are Indian , Jew or Russian and Asians are statistically overpresented in higher professional fields , exam results etc yet escape all that inverted class snobbery</text>

        <text>The authors found that persons of color were heavily presented in stories about crime , and within those stories were more likely to be presented as perpetrators of crime than as persons reacting to or suffering from it . An analysis using recent homicide rates in Philadelphia and a rational model of expected victimization indicated that contrary to a realistic conflict explanation , White actors were overpresented as victims of violence compared to their roles as perpetrators , and persons of color were overpresented as perpetrators of violence against White actors .</text>

      <note>OVERPRESENT-V NOTES: Added by Julia based on BOLT. No VNcls. This sense corresponds to present.01, not present.102, the clinical sense. A different sense should be made for that if it comes up. (from overpresent.01-v)</note>
